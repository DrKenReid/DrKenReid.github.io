          <h1 data-animation="bounceInDown" data-delay="100ms">I Love Reading.</h1>

          <p data-animation="bounceInDown" data-delay="200ms">Most of my life I loved reading. About &frac34; through my Ph.D. I realised I was only reading about research - be it papers or textbooks. This saddened me.</p> 

          <p data-animation="bounceInDown" data-delay="300ms">So - I made a challenge to myself to try and read 2 books a month in the final year of my Ph.D., which probably helped keep me sane in my thesis writing months! To continue staying sane, I have decided to continue to encourage myself to read in a similar fashion. This page will help in this goal.</p>

          <p data-animation="bounceInDown" data-delay="500ms">Please note, I considering "reading" and "listening to audiobooks" to be the same thing. Don't be a petty gatekeeper. The only time, I admit, reading text in a literal sense is "better", is when you're reading dense material, such as research. I learned this myself when attempting to listen to Marcus Aurelius' <i>Meditations</i>. Each sentence is teeming with wisdom, and you need time to contemplate each carefully written word. But - for most reading - audiobooks are simply more convenient, though I still love reading a physical book, too.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="container">
          <h1 data-animation="bounceInDown" data-delay="100ms">Stoicism.</h1>

            <p data-animation="bounceInDown" data-delay="200ms">In recent years I became interested and am now convinced by the philosophy of stoicism. I've included this in the "reading" section of my site as most of what I've learned about this branch of philosophy was from reading the notes, journals and publications of the original stoics.</p>

            <p data-animation="bounceInDown" data-delay="300ms">Since I first learned of determinism in my late teens, I have been convinced that the universe is both incomprehensively complex and following a specific, pre-determined path. However, by the mechanism of evolution, we are sentient and consider ourselves to be free willed. I believe this is purely because we are too finite, minute and temporary to comprehend the predetermined nature of the universe at an atomic level. So - we bumble along happily in the belief of free will, all while following an infinitely more complex version of a ball rolling down a hill. </p>

            <p data-animation="bounceInDown" data-delay="400ms">Now what does determinism have to do with stoicism? Well, very little. Bear with me a moment longer, and I'll explain. Many philosophers I've spoken to (mostly academic but I don't belittle the musings of untrained minds - I am one after all!) who also believe in determinism often make use of the words "destiny" and "fate". I do not. I think these words have an intrinsic spiritual or deistic implication. I lay no claim to knowing the means and mechanisms by which the universe operates or how, what, or if it originated. As such I will make no further decisions in that direction, other than say "I don't know." Which is why I am very wary of those who claim to have the answer to the ultimate questions of existence. I prefer to stay skeptical but curious. Religion offers answers to questions without a speck of evidence, and I think that's no fun at all.</p>

            <p data-animation="bounceInDown" data-delay="500ms">Religion fills two vital roles in societies around the globe. There is a major theme in each - and it's not believing in a creator, a great power, having faith, praying or following some oddly specific rules, its commonality is in community. Regardless of the number of Gods, Goddesses, minor deities, or non-anthropomorphised entities, community is always a vital aspect of religion. It is the gap that is filled in otherwise quiet societies that are populated with strangers. This is why I encourage my friends and families to participate in humanist activities - charity work, weddings, social gatherings and such. The role that religion has filled, up until now, has been vital, but is in no way unique to religion, and I think as religion perishes in the west we must uphold the positive aspects religion provided. The second vital role religion claims to solve, and does to an extent, is providing moral guidance on how to act, how to be. The problem is that most religions provide this in the form of conflicting, out-dated or plainly evil laws <sup><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+2%3A18-25&version=NIV">[1]</a><a href="http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=2&verse=191">[2]</a><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-13.htm">[3]</a></sup>.</p>

            <p data-animation="bounceInDown" data-delay="600ms">Philosophy is described as "the rational investigation of the truths and principles of being, knowledge, or conduct." <sup><a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/philosophy">[4]</a></sup>. Which is the basis of modern day scientific methodology, too. The main point is - from the outset and basic description of the <i>entire spectrum of philosophy</i>, rational investigation is stated to be the principle component. Thinking for oneself, deciding for yourself the truth of all things. Investigation, deduction, curiosity. This is how the second offering of religion can be replaced - by individual investigation and introspection. Why follow the rules of a single text when you can instead read dozens of conflicting or competing texts, talk to several experts of differing opinions, and come to your own, instead? Besides - even if you're unwilling to give up your God(s) - didn't (t)he(y) provide you with sentience, a mind, reason and logic? Judge by your own experiences and the accounts of others how you should act in this world.</p>

            <p data-animation="bounceInDown" data-delay="700ms"> Now I'm getting to the crux of my point. If religion cannot provide an objective morality, then your own recourse is to forge and anneal your own set of ethics. I have read the texts of various philosophers (though I'm well aware I've barely scratched the surface). I started with Descartes in my old philosophy 101 class, and have since read of Nihilism, Hedonism and Epicureanism, Confucianism (though I admit this all the Eastern philosophy I've read), and of course, as this section is titled, Stoicism.</p>

            <p data-animation="bounceInDown" data-delay="800ms">I first found Stoicism by happenstance. I came across a quote by Epictetus, whose writings still resound with me the most. Sadly, I cannot remember the specific quote, but here is one of many great ones:</p>

            <em>"In life our first job is this. To divide and distinguish things into two categories: externals I cannot control, but the choices I make with regard to them I do control. Where will I find good and bad? In me, in my choices."</em>

            <p>And while not strictly related to Stoicism, still another great one from Epictetus:</p>

            <em>"It is impossible for a man to learn what he thinks he already knows."</em>
